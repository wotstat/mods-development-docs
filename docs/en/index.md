## Motivation

::: warning Help translate
The original language of the documentation is Russian. Most of the documentation has not been translated into English. If you know how to develop modifications, you can translate the articles using AI and review them for accuracy.
:::

World of Tanks is a game that‚Äôs very well suited for creating mods. However, the entry barrier is quite high: there‚Äôs no official documentation, and community guides are incomplete or outdated.

This site aims to help both newcomers and experienced developers quickly set up everything needed for mod creation and find answers to common questions.

In the First Steps section you will set up your environment (syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic compilation) and then step‚Äëby‚Äëstep build two popular mods: a fast equipment demount helper and an armor penetration calculator.
