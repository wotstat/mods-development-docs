# Welcome to WoT Mods Documentation
This documentation is for Lesta's Mir Tankov first. If you are looking for modding documentation for Wargaming's World of Tanks, please say me and I will try to help you.

Some parts of docs already translated to English, but most of them are still in Russian.

If you know about mods development and can help with translation on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wotstat/mods-development-docs).
